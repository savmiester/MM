                              Hello there !! Grew up in an absoulte fun loving and liberal family.Childhood was fun with cousins and friends along with a list of extra curicular activities. Had an awesome adventures fun time growing up, thanks to my loving and understanding parents who allowed me to choose things according to my will. </p>
                                  <p>I finished my bachelors in IT in India and worked for a couple of years. Those were the amazing times of  life packed with clubing, partying, watching movies,attending all the cultural occassions and and super fun trips. Hanging every day in the city and weekends marked with treking adventures </p>
                                  <p>Decided to come to USA for my masters, credit goes to all my mentors in Sophoi(my workspace) and my motivating friends. Masters was an exciting journey with loads of hardships and too many lessons in life :) Also had loads of house parties, participating in school functions and exploring America. </p>
                                 <p> After Masters I started working in New York City which is the most happeneing city according to me. Love travelling to different places , have almost covered most united states.</p>
                                 <p>After all the checklist of studies, work and hobbies , had marriage on the list ;) Met an amazing person , Mayuresh. Love struck and decided to spend the rest of the life with this awesome guy. 
                            
                            </p>

                                <img src="img/mayurThumb.jpg" class="thumb" alt="Mayuresh" />
                                Born in amchi Mumbai to the most loving and caring parent,  I am ever thankful to them for always giving me the freedom to pursue my interests. A sister who has the uncanny ability of being there when I need her the most. I played my role of the younder annoying brother to perfection.</p>
                            <p>Like most of the kids of my generation I grew up watching Giant Robot, Mowgli, Duck Tails Tailspin etc and ofcouse religiously following cricket and idolizing Sachin. After finishing school from St. Francis Xavier High School, I did my Diploma in Electronics from LTIT. This is where my longest relationship with any city ended. Pune is where I did my Engineering in Electronics from Bharti Vodyapeeth. Immediately afterwards the silicon valley of India, Bangalore beckoned. I started my professional career with Infosys.</p>
                            <p>The shores of Boston is where I first landed in US. It also happened to be the year the Red Sox won their first World Series after 86 years, I take no credit for this coincidence ;). This is also where my current love for the Patriots grew. Moving south I worked for a year with Vanguard in the city of brotherly love Philly. The southwards journey continued to Nashville where I currently work for Davita.</p>
                            <p>I am a big movie buff entertainig/annoying my friends with movie dialogues. Beatles, Bod Dylan and Nirvana fill in the space when I am not listening to Pink Floyd. Lots of hobbies came and went, but the only constant from the streets of Mumbai has been the love for cricket. Other hobbies keeping me occupied these days are hiking, running and cycling. </p>
                            <p>All these amazing years spent and fun times had pale in comparison to the year 2013. Cause its the year I met the most amazing girl there is, Madhavi. The girl with whom I wish to spend many more amazing years till the end of days.</p>

                            <h2>HOW WE MET</h2>
                                <p>Her side of story</p>
                                <p>In this big big world we all get lonely sometimes. And as days pass by, the hunt for the right person takes a toll. In such days of struggle I saw a profile on a matrimonial site. Sent a request and by god's grace did hear back . In rudimentary stages it was more of texting and less of talking . Now the talks just don't get over :) !</p>
                                <p>When Mayuresh was in India on vacation he called up and asked wether I was ready to take a plunge into the marriage boat with him. Although I was excited and really wanted too, it was BIG decision none the less. I told him I was freaking out. Seeing my freaked out state he decided to meet me in his transit stop at Newark airport. I reach the airport and I see a guy in a Sherwani. His first words upon seeing me we re "See, I am ready! Are u ready to marry me". That swept me off my feet and I knew had no reason to fear.</p>
                                <p>On my first visit to Nashville he continued to amaze me. He had like hundreds, not kidding, hundreds of roses (yellow, pink and reds) presented to me at different times during my stay. Later I was blow away by a super duper surprise waiting for me at the hotel room. He has the room decorated with candles, gifts and more flowers. Things one dreams off were coming true in real life :D</p>
                                <p>On one of his visit to New York I decided to goto skydiving . After a thrilling   experience of flying in the sky, I looked down on the vast green fields to see an absolutely breathtaking surprise for me . His official proposal :)</p>

                                <p>His of story</p>
                                <p>They say there are two side to every story, One is her side, and the other is the wrong side ;). So here goes the wrong side of it. I was leading a happy life, running marathons, hiking and doing bicycle tours. Friends and family joked that I was literally running away from marriage :). Mounting pressure form friends and family made me registered for the matrimony site. One fine day I get a message from her, and we hit it off immediately.</p>
                                <p>Mostly our conversations used to be long running text conversations and some phone calls. After a 6 hours long web chat, a few phone conversation and a many a texts later we decide to meet. I botch up the plan to spend the afternoon in New York, but we did manage salvage it and spend a couple of hours before I flew out.</p>
                                <p>It was sometimes during my visit in India, I had an epiphany that I was wasting my time. She was everything I wanted in a girl. Beautiful, has a smile that can light up your day, smart, witty, funny, frank, honest and upfront. Sometimes what you want is right there in front of you, you just have to take a moment to listen to your sub-conscience and take the leap of faith. Now, all I could do was ask and hope she said yes. And she did say YES!!!</p>
                                <p>Over time she continues to amaze and surprise me and feel like the luckiest guy on the planet. I had opened up the Matrimony account with a lot of apprehension, and now I ask myself, why didn't I do it sooner…</p>

                            <h2>THE ENGAGEMENT</h2>
                            <p>Mayuresh wanted to surprise her for the proposal and skydive gave him the ideal opportunity. The skydive almost got cancelled due to bad weather.Luckily the sky cleared and just before the jump he made an excuse and went to do the setup. Her friends did their part and made sure she was the last one to jump off the plane. When the chute opened there it was bright blue banner contrasting against the lush green grass field. The jump master did his job and landed her right next to the banner, when Mayuresh was waiting for her with the ring. He got down on a knee and all and rest as they say is history.</p>
